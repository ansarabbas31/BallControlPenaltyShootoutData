Take the penalty spot and prove your skills in this exciting penalty shootout game! Swipe to shoot, tap to save — every decision counts. Drag the ball and swipe toward the goal to take your shot. Aim for the corners to beat the keeper or go down the middle and catch them off guard. The direction of your swipe determines exactly where the ball goes. When it's your turn to defend, read the opponent's intentions and tap the zone where you think the ball is heading. Quick reactions and smart predictions will keep your net clean. The goal is divided into six zones — top-left, top-center, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-center, and bottom-right. Master all of them to become unpredictable on offense and unbeatable on defense. Play a complete 5-round penalty shootout. If scores are tied after regulation, sudden death rounds keep the tension alive until a winner is decided. Choose from three difficulty levels: Easy, where the CPU goalkeeper is forgiving and the striker is less accurate; Medium, offering a balanced challenge for most players; and Hard, where the keeper reads your shots and the striker targets the corners with deadly precision. Track your progress with overall win rate, shot accuracy, and save rate, and analyze your performance zone by zone to discover your strengths and weaknesses. Browse your full shootout history with scores, dates, and difficulty levels. Enjoy smooth SpriteKit animation as the goalkeeper dives, stretches, and reacts to every shot with fluid movement. Every goal, save, and miss feels dynamic and satisfying. With simple controls and deep gameplay, the game is easy to pick up but hard to master — no complicated menus, just swipe, tap, and compete. Play anytime, anywhere; one more round is never enough
